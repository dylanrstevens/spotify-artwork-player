# Spotify Artwork Player

The Spotify Artwork Player is an application for those who love to view the album artwork in Spotify, but don't necessarily want Spotify open at all times.

Built with the intention of mimicking the aesthetic of Apple Music's "MiniPlayer" function.

Keep the album art of whatever song you are currently playing on your screen at all times, front-and-center, off in the corner, or anywhere else on your desktop.

## Installation

App is still in production.

Alpha release 1.0 TBA soon...
